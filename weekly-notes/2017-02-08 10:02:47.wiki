= what we go over =
how to make object storage work better with deep learning packages
    - what are developers doing today?
        - naitive access to object store, 
    - either s3 or swift can grab chunks of data naitively. might be called multipart
        - s3 streaming.
        - might be a code example of this


== User stories ==
- Tensorflow dev
    - optimally useing the network
    - how easy it is to get your files in s3 and share them (publish for others to grab)
    - work with s3 or swift?
    
= next steps =
- project specifications

- custom data readers 

- tf.textlinereader
    - will just make our own. import it and use it simularly
    - pip install -e or something 
        - will import the project
        - pylogmat for an example
        
matt will get back to use later today or tommarow with more info on textlinereader
